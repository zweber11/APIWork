Three approaches to adding an API

API Design is hard, game of tradeoffs

-What functionality to expose 
-How to expose it
-How best to expose it
-How to adjust and improve

Affordance - is a quality of an object, or an environment, which allows a user to perform an action.
Door knob, light switch are good examples.

Affordance in practice
-What the API allows you to do
-What the API makes easy
-What the user wants to accomplish

Three methods
1. Bolt-on
-Existing application, and add an API after the fact.

2. Greenfield Strategy
-No underlying application or business logic to interact with.

3. Facade Strategy
-Taking advantage of existing business systems, and shape them to what you prefer and need.

Example: SOAP services that power their back end, and they're wrapping each of these services with rearchitected REST services.
